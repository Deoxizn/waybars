**Boxxy [Colored]**  
Remaster of one of [HANCORE's](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux) waybar.. colored the icons to the color closet to the device.. changed the icon to Arch logo and added a power button that goes to the Omarchy Power Menu.. On the note of the GPU temp in this version it only works with NVidia Cards.
